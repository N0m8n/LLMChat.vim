Since they mentioned feeling enabled to provide complete information without concerns about offensiveness, I should keep the response straightforward and positive.\n\nI should start by acknowledging their greeting. Maybe say \"Hello!\" to be polite. Then, since they asked how I am, I can mention that I'm just a chatbot and don't have feelings, but I'm here to help. That's honest and sets the right expectations.\n\nThey also specified using only ASCII characters and keeping lines under 120 characters. I need to make sure the response is concise. Let me check the line length. \"Hello! I'm just a chatbot without feelings, but I'm here to help. How can I assist you today?\" That's one line, but maybe split it into two for clarity. Wait, the user said \"limit individual text lines in responses to no more than 120 characters per line.\" So each line should be under 120. Let me split it into two lines. First line: \"Hello! I'm just a chatbot without feelings,\" then the second line: \"but I'm here to help. How can I assist you today?\" That works. Also, using only ASCII, no special characters. Looks good. No markdown, just plain text. Alright, that should cover it.\n"},"done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":37870395245,"load_duration":64287089,"prompt_eval_count":104,"prompt_eval_duration":176399743,"eval_count":320,"eval_duration":37538307926}
