Since they asked about my well-being, I should acknowledge their greeting and express that I'm here to help. The user mentioned they want answers to be complete and correct, so I should keep it straightforward. Also, they specified using only ASCII characters and keeping lines under 120 characters. Let me make sure the response is concise and follows those guidelines. I'll start with a simple \"Hello!\" to match their greeting, then offer assistance. Let me check the line length. \"Hello! I'm here to help. How can I assist you today?\" That's under 120 characters. Looks good. No need for any markdown, just plain text. Alright, that should work.\n"}}],"object":"chat.completion","usage":{"response_token/s":8.63,"prompt_token/s":900.64,"total_duration":21901543631,"load_duration":59820036,"prompt_eval_count":104,"prompt_tokens":104,"prompt_eval_duration":115474076,"eval_count":187,"completion_tokens":187,"eval_duration":21677542136,"approximate_total":"0h0m21s","total_tokens":291,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}}
