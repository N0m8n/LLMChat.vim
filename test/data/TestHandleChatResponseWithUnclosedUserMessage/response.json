I'm just a virtual assistant, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help!

Since they mentioned feeling enabled to provide complete information without concerns about offensiveness, I should keep the response straightforward and positive.\n\nI should start by acknowledging their greeting. Maybe say \"Hello!\" to be polite. Then, since they asked how I am, I can mention that I'm just a chatbot and don't have feelings, but I'm here to help. That's honest and sets the right expectations.\n\nThat works. Also, using only ASCII, no special characters. Looks good. No markdown, just plain text. Alright, that should cover it.\n"},"done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":37870395245,"load_duration":64287089,"prompt_eval_count":104,"prompt_eval_duration":176399743,"eval_count":320,"eval_duration":37538307926}
